Dikenocracy — a framework for algorithmic justice where governance is treated as an engineering problem and power is an immutable function, not a political mandate.
This repository hosts post-political governance architectures, system-level political design, and executable models of justice.
It is built on a simple premise:
Politics does not fail because of bad people.
It fails because it is not a system.
What is Dikenocracy?
Dikenocracy is a governance model based on the ancient Greek concept of δίκη (dike) — justice as an objective balance between actions and consequences — formalized as algorithms, metrics, and automated liability.
In Dikenocracy:
Power is not held by people, parties, or elites
Power is held by an immutable justice function
Damage automatically generates liability
Profit is mathematically linked to public benefit
Deception and manipulation are economically unprofitable
Governance operates through thresholds, not discretion
Justice ceases to be a metaphor — and becomes code.
Core Principles
Algorithmic Justice
Governance decisions are executed by transparent, open algorithms rather than subjective authority.
Objective Metrics (Physical Truth Layer)
Social, economic, and ecological outcomes are grounded in verifiable physical data rather than opinion or consensus.
Automatic Accountability
Harm, aggression, corruption, or systemic damage trigger predefined consequences without political arbitration.
Incentive Alignment
Individual, corporate, and state-level self-interest is mathematically constrained to increase system stability.
Post-Political Governance
No elected rulers. No lobbying. No ideology arbitration.
Operators are contracted against systemic performance thresholds and removed automatically upon failure.
Repository Scope
The world repository functions as a political systems laboratory.
It contains:
Governance frameworks and constitutional architectures
Algorithmic justice protocols
Economic incentive models
Security, liability, and anti-aggression mechanisms
Post-democratic and post-national governance concepts
Drafts, specifications, critiques, and future simulations
This is not a party platform.
This is not an electoral project.
This is a systems repository.

The structure will evolve as models mature.
Scientific Foundation
Dikenocracy is not a purely philosophical construct.
Its governance logic is grounded in Information Physics, specifically the Theory of the Informational Universe (TIU), where:
Reality is constrained by information flow
Truth must be anchored in physical observables
Stable systems emerge from feedback, not authority
This foundation is implemented through the Physical Truth Layer, which supplies objective data to governance algorithms.
