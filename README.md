Dikenocracy is a framework for post-political governance in which justice and coordination are treated as engineering problems, not as matters of ideology, leadership, or persuasion.

This repository hosts governance architectures, algorithmic justice protocols, and system-level design artifacts that explore how power, accountability, and collective action can operate without discretionary authority.

The core premise is simple:

Politics does not fail because of bad people.
It fails because it is not designed as a system.

What Is Dikenocracy?

Dikenocracy is a governance model derived from the ancient Greek concept of δίκη (díkē) — justice as an objective balance between actions and consequences.

In Dikenocracy, justice is not a moral metaphor or a political promise.
It is a formalized mechanism.

Key characteristics:

Power is not held by individuals, parties, or elites

Power is exercised through predefined, auditable system rules

Damage generates liability automatically

Incentives are constrained to reduce systemic harm

Governance operates through thresholds and conditions, not discretion

Justice ceases to be rhetorical.
It becomes structural.

Core Principles
Algorithmic Justice

Governance decisions are executed by transparent, rule-based mechanisms rather than subjective authority or interpretation.

Physical Verifiability

System decisions rely on verifiable, externally auditable data, not opinion, popularity, or institutional consensus.

Automatic Accountability

Harm, corruption, aggression, or systemic damage trigger predefined consequences without political arbitration.

Incentive Alignment

Individual, corporate, and state-level self-interest is constrained so that stability is more profitable than exploitation.

Post-Political Governance

No elected rulers

No lobbying

No ideological arbitration

Operators are contracted against measurable performance thresholds and removed automatically upon failure.

Repository Scope

The World repository functions as a political systems laboratory.

It contains:

Governance and justice protocols

Economic incentive and liability architectures

Security, defense, and anti-aggression mechanisms

Exit, integration, and scope-limitation frameworks

Drafts, critiques, and future simulation concepts

This is not:

a party platform

an electoral project

a manifesto

a movement seeking adherence

This is a systems repository.

The structure will evolve as designs mature.

Scientific and Methodological Position

Dikenocracy does not require acceptance of any particular worldview, philosophy, or theory of reality.

Its governance logic is grounded in:

systems engineering

feedback-based control

verifiability over interpretation

reversibility over permanence

scope limitation over authority expansion

Any research materials included in this repository are non-normative and do not constitute a foundation for governance validity.
