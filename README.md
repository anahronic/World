World
A repository for post-political governance architectures, algorithmic justice, and system-level political design.
This repository aggregates political, governance, and civilizational frameworks developed under a single guiding principle:
Politics should be replaced by verifiable systems.
Justice should be executable.
Power should be constrained by code.
The flagship framework hosted here is Dikenocracy.
What is Dikenocracy?
Dikenocracy is a model of governance based on the ancient Greek concept of δίκη (dike) — justice as an objective balance between actions and consequences — formalized as algorithms, metrics, and automated liability.
In Dikenocracy:
Power is not held by people, parties, or elites
Power is held by an immutable justice function
Damage automatically generates liability
Profit is mathematically linked to public benefit
Lies and manipulation are economically unprofitable
Justice ceases to be a metaphor — and becomes code.
Core Principles
Algorithmic Justice
Decisions are made by transparent, open algorithms, not subjective authority.
Objective Metrics
Social, economic, and ecological outcomes are measured using verifiable data (Physical Truth Layer).
Automatic Accountability
Harm, aggression, corruption, or deception trigger predefined consequences without political discretion.
Alignment of Incentives
Individual or state-level self-interest is mathematically aligned with system stability and public good.
Post-Political Governance
No elections of rulers. No lobbying. No ideology wars.
Operators are hired against KPIs and removed automatically on failure.
Repository Scope
The world repository is intended as a political laboratory, containing:
Governance models and constitutional frameworks
Algorithmic justice systems
Economic protocols and incentive architectures
Security and liability mechanisms
Post-democratic and post-national governance concepts
Drafts, specifications, simulations, and critiques
This is not a party program and not a manifesto for elections.
It is a systems repository.

Structure will evolve as ideas mature.
Status
Conceptual framework: active
Technical formalization: in progress
Public critique and iteration: open
Implementation: future parallel systems
Intellectual Position
This repository assumes that:
Traditional politics is structurally obsolete
Democracy without objective feedback collapses into populism
Technocracy without accountability collapses into oligarchy
Truth must be grounded in physical reality, not consensus
Governance must be treated as an engineering problem
License & Use
All ideas here are published for open discussion, critique, and extension.
Forking, citation, and adaptation are encouraged.
Closed, authoritarian, or coercive reinterpretations are explicitly rejected.

Final Note
We are not asking the old world for permission.
We are building a new one beside it.
