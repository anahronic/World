# DKP-0-ORACLE-001  
## Physical Truth Layer Protocol (PTL)

### Version
0.5

### Status
Immutable Core Protocol — Final Frozen Version

---

## 1. Purpose

The Physical Truth Layer (PTL) defines the sole admissible interface between physical reality and the Dikenocracy governance system.

Its function is to produce an objective, cryptographically verifiable, and physically grounded representation of reality, independent of political, economic, or human discretion.

The PTL produces state only. It does not interpret meaning, intent, value, or policy.

---

## 2. System Position and Anchoring

This protocol is an integral extension of Appendix A.2 of the Code of Planetary Synergy and is anchored to Genesis Block #0 (2025-12-10).

Compatibility with the Genesis Block physical anchors and parameters is a mandatory validity condition for any PTL implementation.

---

## 3. Scope

This protocol governs:
- Oracle admissibility
- Data ingestion constraints
- Oracle weighting and ownership caps
- Temporal validity of data
- Data aggregation methodology
- Divergence detection and arbitration
- Production of raw physical indices required by higher layers

This protocol explicitly excludes:
- Human testimony or manual input
- Semantic interpretation
- Policy reasoning
- Cross-layer feedback or parameter adjustment

---

## 4. Core Definitions

**Physical State Vector S(t)**  
A time-indexed vector of physically measurable variables.

**Oracle Source**  
A hardware-bound system producing cryptographically signed physical measurements.

**Oracle Owner**  
A natural or legal person controlling one or more oracle sources.

**Confidence Weight wᵢ**  
A normalized reliability contribution of an oracle source.

**Coverage**  
The fraction of the target physical domain that is actively observed by valid oracle sources.

**Data Staleness (TTL)**  
The maximum admissible age of a datum before its confidence weight is forced to zero.

**Independent Oracle Classes**  
Distinct measurement modalities defined by physical separation of sensing mechanisms.

**Divergence Event**  
A statistically significant disagreement between independent oracle classes.

---

## 5. Independent Oracle Classes

The PTL defines the following independent oracle classes:

- Orbital (satellite-based remote sensing)
- Ground (fixed terrestrial or marine sensors)
- Autonomous (mobile or robotic sensing platforms)

Divergence detection applies exclusively across classes, not within a single class.

---

## 6. Data Ingestion Rules

1. All data MUST be:
   - Cryptographically signed at the source
   - Time-stamped with a verifiable clock
   - Traceable to a registered oracle identity
   - Delivered in an open, publicly decodable schema

2. Proprietary or non-decodable data formats SHALL be rejected regardless of signature validity.

3. Zero-knowledge proofs MAY be used to verify authenticity without revealing proprietary sensor internals.

4. No data may be modified, normalized, or interpreted at ingestion time.

---

## 7. Oracle Weighting and Anti-Collusion Constraints

1. Maximum confidence weight per oracle source: **5%**

2. Maximum combined confidence weight per oracle owner: **4%**

3. Ownership caps apply regardless of the number or distribution of devices.

4. Exceeding caps results in:
   - Automatic zeroing of excess weight
   - Slashing of the violating owner's remaining stake, where applicable

---

## 8. Temporal Validity and Data Staleness

1. All data types SHALL have an explicit TTL.

2. Data exceeding its TTL SHALL have its confidence weight set to zero.

3. Stale data MUST NOT be extrapolated, substituted, or interpolated.

---

## 9. Data Aggregation Method

The PTL aggregates admissible data using a deterministic Bayesian ensemble.

- Oracle inputs act as likelihood updates, not votes
- Prior weights reflect long-term reliability
- Posterior distributions define S(t)

Given identical inputs, aggregation MUST be reproducible.

---

## 10. Divergence Detection and Arbitration

1. A Divergence Event is triggered when posterior distributions across independent oracle classes differ by more than **7%**.

2. Upon Divergence Event:
   - A divergence flag is emitted
   - All dependent state-based transactions SHALL be frozen

3. Maximum arbitration window: **14 days**

4. Resolution requires convergence within threshold or exclusion of faulty sources.

---

## 11. Outputs

The PTL produces the following immutable outputs:

- Signed Physical State Vector S(t)
- Oracle confidence weights
- Coverage metrics
- Divergence flags
- Raw Biosphere Integrity Index **B(t)**

B(t) is a physically derived, unnormalized measure and contains no policy-level adjustments.

---

## 12. Systemic Halt Conditions

All dependent governance execution layers MUST halt if any of the following conditions occur:

- Aggregate confidence falls below **60%**
- Global coverage falls below the minimum operational threshold
- Systemic oracle integrity is compromised

### Crisis Mercy Exception

If a Crisis Mercy status is formally activated under Appendix A.4 of the Code of Planetary Synergy, and the PTL confirms that oracle degradation is caused by non-anthropogenic global events, enforcement of Systemic Halt MAY be temporarily deferred.

Such deferral:
- DOES NOT modify TTL values
- DOES NOT restore stale data weights
- DOES NOT alter aggregation logic
- IS strictly time-limited in accordance with Appendix A.4

---

## 13. Cross-Layer Isolation Invariant

No higher-layer protocol may:
- Influence oracle weights
- Modify TTL values
- Alter aggregation logic
- Suppress divergence flags

Violation constitutes a critical system integrity breach.

## 14. Table of Constants

| Parameter | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Max oracle source weight | 5% |
| Max oracle owner weight | 4% |
| Divergence threshold | 7% |
| Arbitration window | 14 days |
| Systemic confidence halt | < 60% |
| Minimum global coverage | 80% |

---

## 15. TTL Registry (Normative)

| Data Type | Maximum TTL |
|----------|-------------|
| Atmospheric CO₂ concentration | 1 hour |
| Surface temperature (land/sea) | 24 hours |
| Active fire detection | 10 minutes |
| Biodiversity indices | 30 days |
| Land-use change | 7 days |

---

## 16. Non-Override and Finality

This protocol is immutable once deployed.

Any modification requires a new protocol identifier and explicit incompatibility declaration.
