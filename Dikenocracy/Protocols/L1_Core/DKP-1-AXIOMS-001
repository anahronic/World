# DKP-1-AXIOMS-001  
## Axioms Protocol

### Version
0.4

### Status
Core Protocol — Final Freeze Candidate

---

## 1. Purpose

The Axioms Protocol defines the non-negotiable boundary conditions of the Dikenocracy system.

Axioms are not moral statements and not policy goals.  
They are invariant constraints that bound all measurement, optimization, and enforcement logic.

No higher-layer protocol may violate an axiom, regardless of calculated benefit.

---

## 2. System Position and Anchoring

This protocol operates above the Physical Truth Layer (DKP-0-ORACLE-001) and below all impact, justice, and economic protocols.

This protocol is anchored to the predefined axioms stated in the Preamble of the Code of Planetary Synergy and is bound to Genesis Block #0 (2025-12-10).

Any interpretation or implementation of this protocol MUST remain compatible with the immutable civilizational motion equation defined therein.

Axioms do not process data.  
They constrain how data-derived metrics may be interpreted and acted upon.

---

## 3. Axiom Structure

Each axiom is defined as:
- a forbidden state, or
- a hard priority ordering between competing system objectives.

Axioms are evaluated as constraints, not as terms in an optimization function.

---

## 4. Core Axioms

### Axiom A1 — Preservation of Life

System actions MUST NOT knowingly increase irreversible loss of human life **or biospheric life** beyond the minimum required to prevent greater systemic collapse.

The definition of such minimum required conditions is exclusively governed by DKP-4-CRISIS and SHALL NOT be inferred, approximated, or declared by operational, economic, or enforcement protocols.

Life preservation has absolute priority over economic growth, efficiency, or political stability.

---

### Axiom A2 — Systemic Sustainability

System actions MUST NOT degrade long-term system viability in exchange for short-term gains.

Any action that results in sustained degradation of biospheric integrity, as reflected in Physical Truth Layer outputs (including B(t)), constitutes a violation of this axiom.

Actions that improve short-term metrics at the cost of long-term collapse are forbidden.

---

### Axiom A3 — Physical Reality Supremacy

System decisions MUST be grounded in Physical Truth Layer outputs.

Narratives, beliefs, intentions, or declared goals SHALL NOT override measured physical reality.

---

### Axiom A4 — Irreversibility Aversion

System actions SHOULD minimize irreversible damage when reversible alternatives exist.

Irreversible transitions require demonstrable necessity verified by irreversible impact models under DKP-1-IMPACT.

---

### Axiom A5 — Externality Accountability

Actions that shift harm outside the measured system boundary are forbidden unless the externality is explicitly measured and bounded.

Unmeasured externalization is treated as maximum-impact damage.

The full cost of environmental and systemic externalities SHALL be included in the effective cost of any action or product, in accordance with Article 12 of the Code of Planetary Synergy (Full Product Cost).

---

### Axiom A6 — Truth Priority

Suppression, distortion, or strategic withholding of physically verifiable truth is forbidden when it materially affects system stability.

Truth is treated as a structural requirement, not a moral virtue.

---

### Axiom A7 — Minimum Suffering Constraint

Among actions that satisfy all higher-priority axioms, the system SHOULD prefer those minimizing aggregate suffering over time.

Suffering is treated as a measurable state variable of subjects, quantified via physical proxies derived from the Physical State Vector S(t), and SHALL NOT be treated as an ethical objective or optimization target.

---

## 5. Axiom Evaluation Rules

1. Axioms are evaluated before any optimization or scoring.
2. Violation of any axiom invalidates an action regardless of utility score and propagates to higher-layer protocols for enforcement.
3. Axioms are not additive and cannot be traded off against each other.
4. Conflicts between axioms are resolved only by higher-priority axioms.

---

## 6. Priority Ordering

The priority order of axioms is fixed and non-negotiable.

### Priority Ordering Table

| Priority | Axiom ID | Description |
|---------:|----------|-------------|
| 1 | A1 | Preservation of Life |
| 2 | A2 | Systemic Sustainability |
| 3 | A3 | Physical Reality Supremacy |
| 4 | A4 | Irreversibility Aversion |
| 5 | A5 | Externality Accountability |
| 6 | A6 | Truth Priority |
| 7 | A7 | Minimum Suffering Constraint |

Lower-priority axioms SHALL NOT override higher-priority ones.

---

## 7. Prohibited Interpretations

The following interpretations are explicitly forbidden:

- Treating axioms as optimization goals
- Encoding axioms as weighted utility terms
- Temporarily suspending axioms for efficiency
- Overriding axioms by human discretion
- Reinterpreting axioms based on political, cultural, or situational context

---

## 8. Invariance and Finality

Axioms are invariant once deployed.

Any modification requires:
- a new protocol identifier
- explicit declaration of incompatibility
- full-system revalidation under DKP-8-SIMULATION
- ratification by no less than **67% of active validating nodes**, as defined in Appendix A.5 of the Code of Planetary Synergy
