DKP-1-IDENTITY-001
Identity & Subject Protocol
Version
0.4
Status
Final Freeze Candidate

1. Purpose
The Identity & Subject Protocol defines what constitutes a Subject within the Dikenocracy system and how actions, effects, and responsibility are causally bound to that Subject across time, delegation layers, and system boundaries.
This protocol establishes attribution, not punishment.
 It performs identity binding and responsibility linkage only.
This protocol does not:
measure impact magnitude,
calculate justice,
assign sanctions or compensation,
interpret intent, motive, or moral value.

2. System Position
This protocol operates:
above DKP-0-ORACLE-001 (Physical Truth Layer),
alongside DKP-1-IMPACT-001 (Impact Measurement Protocol),
below DKP-1-JUSTICE-001 (Justice Function Protocol),
prior to all economic, governance, security, and enforcement protocols.

All attribution performed by this protocol MUST rely exclusively on outputs produced by DKP-1-IMPACT-001.

3. Core Definitions
3.1 Subject
A Subject is any entity capable of initiating, amplifying, sustaining, or failing to prevent a state transition that is measurable under DKP-1-IMPACT-001.
Subjects include, but are not limited to:
individual humans,
legal entities,
collective groups,
decentralized organizations (e.g., DAOs),
automated or algorithmic systems,
artificial intelligences,
hybrid human–machine assemblies.
Subject status is functional, not moral or legal.

3.2 Action
An Action is any intervention, omission, or sustained process attributable to a Subject that produces a measurable change in the Physical State Vector S(t).
Failure to act SHALL be treated as an Action when omission contributes causally to measurable impact.

3.3 Responsibility
Responsibility is the persistence of causal linkage between a Subject and measurable impacts arising from its actions or omissions, independent of intent, awareness, foresight, or justification.

4. Identity Binding Invariant
For every detected impact vector Iᵢ produced by DKP-1-IMPACT-001:
at least one Subject SHALL be causally attributable,
attribution MUST be traceable through an auditable causal chain,
absence of intent, prediction, or awareness SHALL NOT invalidate attribution.
Unattributed or untraceable impacts constitute a critical system violation.

5. Delegation and Automation
Delegation transfers execution, not responsibility.
Where a Subject:
delegates action to another Subject,
deploys automated or algorithmic systems,
operates through intermediaries, platforms, or agents,
the originating Subject SHALL retain causal responsibility unless an explicit, auditable counter-binding is recorded and validated.
Artificial intelligences and automated systems SHALL be treated as Subjects for attribution purposes but SHALL NOT acquire exemption, immunity, or sovereignty.

6. Collective and Distributed Subjects
Where actions arise from coordinated, collective, or emergent behavior:
responsibility MAY be distributed across multiple Subjects,
distribution SHALL be proportional to measurable causal contribution,
collective attribution SHALL NOT erase individual responsibility.
Temporary coalitions, swarms, and decentralized collectives constitute valid Subjects for the duration of their active coordination.

7. Temporal Persistence of Identity
Responsibility SHALL persist across time as long as at least one of the following holds:
a) downstream impacts remain measurable,
 b) the Subject continues to benefit from the originating action,
 c) the Subject retains the capacity to mitigate, reverse, or limit further harm.
Termination, dissolution, or transformation of a Subject SHALL NOT invalidate historical attribution.

8. Cascading Impact Attribution
A Subject SHALL be considered causally responsible not only for direct first-order impacts, but also for downstream impacts when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
a) the downstream impact is causally linked through a traceable chain of state transitions measured under DKP-1-IMPACT-001,
 b) the impact occurs within a declared or logically inferred impact horizon Δt,
 c) the impact exceeds or materially contributes to at least one axiom-defined reference bound Bᵢ.
Lack of foresight, predictability, or statistical expectation SHALL NOT negate responsibility.

9. Nonlinear Cascade Events
A Nonlinear Cascade Event is a state transition in which a small or localized initial impact produces a disproportionately large system-level effect through known physical, ecological, social, or informational feedback mechanisms.
Where such an event is detected:
the originating Subject SHALL be fully causally linked to the cascade origin,
responsibility MAY be distributed if multiple initiating actions are detected,
rarity, novelty, or statistical improbability SHALL NOT constitute exemption.

10. Second- and Higher-Order Effects
Second-order effects arise from immediate reactions to an action.
 Third-order effects arise from adaptive responses to second-order effects.
Such effects SHALL be attributed to the originating Subject when:
a) the effects are physically or informationally measurable, and
 b) attribution does not require speculative modeling of intent or belief.
Responsibility decays only when causal linkage falls below Physical Truth Layer confidence thresholds.

11. Cultural and Cognitive Harm
Cultural and cognitive harm constitutes valid systemic impact when measurable indicators demonstrate:
a) persistent degradation of shared symbolic systems, language coherence, or knowledge transmission, or
 b) sustained increases in population-level cognitive distortion, disinformation persistence, or loss of epistemic capacity.
Such harm SHALL be treated as a systemic externality even in the absence of immediate physical damage.
Attribution SHALL be proportional to:
reach,
persistence,
amplification potential of the contributing action.

12. Non-Exemption Clause
No Subject SHALL be exempt from attribution based on:
status,
authority,
jurisdiction,
ideology,
cultural or moral justification,
delegation to automation,
temporal delay between action and effect.
Responsibility follows causality, not hierarchy.

13. Cross-Layer Isolation
This protocol SHALL NOT:
measure impact magnitude,
evaluate justice or proportionality,
assign sanctions or compensation,
override or reinterpret outputs of DKP-1-IMPACT-001.
Violation constitutes a critical architectural breach.

14. Protocol Finality
Once finalized, this protocol is immutable.
Any modification requires:
a new protocol identifier,
explicit declaration of incompatibility,
full-system simulation under DKP-8-SIMULATION.
