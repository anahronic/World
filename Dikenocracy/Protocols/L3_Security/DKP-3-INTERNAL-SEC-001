# DKP-3-INTERNAL-SEC-001

**Internal Security & System Integrity Protocol**

Version: 0.3
Status: Freeze Candidate 
Layer: L3 – Security / Integrity

---

## 1. Purpose

The Internal Security & System Integrity Protocol defines how the Dikenocracy system preserves its internal coherence, correctness, and causal integrity in the presence of errors, manipulation attempts, or hostile actions.

Internal Security within DKP is **not** defined as surveillance, prediction, profiling, or ideological control. It is defined strictly as a functional mechanism for:

* detecting integrity violations anchored in Physical Truth Layer (PTL) outputs,
* containing ongoing or imminent system damage,
* preventing further distortion of Impact, Identity, Justice, or Economic execution,
* escalating unresolved or systemic compromise to Fail-Safe protocols.

This protocol exists to protect **system truth, causal attribution, and execution correctness**, not to judge intent, belief, or loyalty.

---

## 2. System Position

This protocol operates:

* strictly downstream of DKP-0-ORACLE-001 (Physical Truth Layer),
* downstream of DKP-1-IDENTITY-001, DKP-1-IMPACT-001, DKP-1-JUSTICE-001,
* in coordination with DKP-2-FINANCE-001, DKP-2-ASSETS-001, DKP-2-LABOR-001,
* upstream of DKP-3-DEFENSE-001 and DKP-3-ANTITERROR-001,
* upstream of DKP-4-ERROR-001 and DKP-4-CRISIS-001.

This protocol SHALL NOT:

* redefine Physical Truth,
* reinterpret Impact measurements,
* compute Justice outcomes,
* revoke rights or privileges autonomously,
* introduce punishment logic,
* override axiomatic constraints.

All restrictive or corrective effects affecting Subjects SHALL occur exclusively via
formal input triggers submitted to DKP-1-JUSTICE-001 or DKP-1-IDENTITY-001,
never by direct execution at L3.

---

## 3. Core Definitions

### 3.1 Integrity Violation

An Integrity Violation is any detectable deviation between:

* PTL-confirmed physical state,
* protocol-governed system state,
* and executed system behavior,

where such deviation:

* distorts attribution, impact measurement, justice computation, or execution,
* enables unaccountable or non-auditable state transitions,
* or threatens axiomatic bounds.

Integrity Violations are functional conditions, not moral assessments.

---

### 3.2 Internal Threat (DKP-Specific)

An Internal Threat is any Subject, process, or subsystem that:

* attempts to falsify or suppress PTL inputs or outputs,
* attempts to spoof, fragment, or obscure Identity attribution,
* attempts to manipulate Impact measurement pipelines,
* attempts to bypass or override Justice outcomes,
* attempts to corrupt audit trails or execution logs,

and produces or imminently enables an Integrity Violation.

Intent, ideology, affiliation, or declared motivation SHALL NOT be considered.

---

### 3.3 Evidence

Evidence is defined exclusively as cryptographically verifiable commitments anchored to the
Physical Truth Layer and ultimately to Genesis Block #0.

Admissible evidence includes:

* PTL-signed data hashes,
* cryptographic commitments recorded in immutable ledgers,
* execution traces whose hashes are anchored to PTL time indices.

Evidence MUST be:

* auditable and reproducible,
* temporally indexed using DTI-Day (DKP-0-TIME-001),
* immune to discretionary suppression by virtue of cryptographic anchoring,
* traceable to Genesis Block #0 and Proof-of-Synergy consensus rules.

---

## 4. Core Invariants

### 4.1 PTL Supremacy

No internal security action may redefine or override Physical Truth Layer outputs.
Security actions MAY only respond to PTL-confirmed states or PTL-confirmed divergence.

---

### 4.2 Non-Preemptive Constraint

No coercive or restrictive action MAY be initiated based on:

* prediction,
* inferred intent,
* ideological alignment,
* statistical profiling,
* speculative risk modeling.

Only PTL-evidenced, already occurring integrity violations or active attempts to write
invalid or unauthorized state transitions qualify as valid triggers.

---

### 4.3 Minimal Necessary Action

All security actions MUST be:

* strictly proportional to the detected integrity loss,
* limited in scope and duration,
* sufficient only to stop ongoing or imminent damage.

Permanent or expansive actions require escalation to higher layers.

---

### 4.4 Auditability and Reversibility

All actions under this protocol MUST be:

* logged immutably,
* traceable to triggering evidence,
* reversible where physically and logically possible.

Irreversible actions require elevated authorization thresholds and justification.

---

## 5. Security State Model

The Internal Security layer operates as a finite-state system governed by Dikenocratic Time
(DKP-0-TIME-001).

* **S0 – Normal Operation**
  No detected integrity anomalies.

* **S1 – Suspicion**
  Non-coercive evidence collection and heightened verification.
  Maximum duration: 7 DTI-Days.

* **S2 – Confirmed Integrity Violation**
  Targeted containment actions permitted.
  Maximum duration: 14 DTI-Days unless escalated.

* **S3 – Active Compromise**
  Partial system isolation or execution throttling permitted.
  Maximum duration: 3 DTI-Days.

* **S4 – Systemic Compromise**
  Mandatory escalation to DKP-4-CRISIS-001.

State transitions MUST be evidence-driven, auditable, and automatically reverted to S0
upon expiration of the maximum duration unless escalated.

---

## 6. Triggers (PTL-Anchored)

Integrity response MAY be triggered only by:

* Identity Integrity Trigger: PTL-confirmed mismatch in attribution or credential binding,
* Impact Integrity Trigger: PTL-confirmed manipulation or suppression of impact channels,
* Justice Execution Trigger: unauthorized alteration or bypass of justice outcomes,
* Audit Integrity Trigger: PTL-confirmed log tampering or execution opacity.

Any Physical Truth Layer divergence or oracle inconsistency SHALL be handled exclusively
by DKP-0-ORACLE-001. Upon PTL halt or arbitration flag, all L3 execution MUST immediately
suspend and defer to L0 resolution.

---

## 7. Allowed Actions by State

### 7.1 S1 – Suspicion

Permitted actions:

* evidence preservation,
* increased verification frequency,
* mandatory transaction multi-signature requirement for sensitive or high-impact operations,
* challenge-response procedures via Identity protocol.

No artificial throttling, economic slowdown, or discretionary limitation of baseline access
is permitted at this stage.

---

### 7.2 S2 – Confirmed Integrity Violation

Permitted actions:

* scoped privilege revocation (Identity-bound),
* isolation of affected subsystems,
* temporary freeze of disputed transactions or assets,
* initiation of Justice-domain workflows.

---

### 7.3 S3 – Active Compromise

Permitted actions:

* partial execution halt of compromised modules,
* forced safe-mode execution,
* mandatory multi-party authorization for sensitive operations.

---

### 7.4 S4 – Systemic Compromise

Mandatory actions:

* escalation to DKP-4-CRISIS-001,
* request for PTL systemic halt where applicable,
* suspension of non-essential execution paths.

---

## 8. Prohibited Actions (Hard Bans)

This protocol SHALL NOT permit:

* mass surveillance without PTL trigger,
* collective punishment or guilt by association,
* permanent exclusion without Justice-domain outcome,
* secrecy of rules or hidden enforcement logic,
* security actions justified by ideology or narrative,
* concentration of Internal Security execution control.

No Subject, nor any Identity-linked group of Subjects, MAY control more than **4%** of nodes
executing DKP-3-INTERNAL-SEC-001 logic, as defined by oracle and control concentration limits
in DKP-0-ORACLE-001.

Violation constitutes a critical architectural breach.

---

## 9. Due Process and Appeals

All restrictive actions MUST explicitly define:

* triggering PTL evidence,
* violated invariant or integrity rule,
* applied containment scope,
* reversal and appeal conditions under Justice protocol.

---

## 10. Cross-Layer Interfaces

This protocol interfaces with:

* Identity: attribution, revocation, revalidation,
* Impact: pipeline integrity verification,
* Justice: consequence computation and escalation,
* Finance & Assets: freeze / restore semantics,
* Infrastructure & Audit (L8): immutability and verification.

---

## 11. Protocol Self-Tests

The following invariants MUST always hold:

* No PTL evidence → no coercive action,
* Minimal sufficient containment,
* Complete audit trail,
* Preference for reversibility,
* No cross-layer authority overreach.

---

## 12. Versioning and Finality

This protocol is mutable until frozen.

Once finalized:

* any modification requires a new protocol identifier,
* explicit incompatibility declaration,
* full-system simulation under DKP-8-SIMULATION.
