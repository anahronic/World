DKP-6-RESILIENCE-001

System Resilience Under Adversarial Conditions

Version: 1.1  
Status: Freeze  
Layer: L6–L7  
Depends on: DKP-0-ORACLE-001, DKP-1-AXIOMS-001, DKP-1-PREVENTION-001, DKP-7-SCOPE-001, DKP-8-INTEROP-001  
Override: Not permitted

\---

1\. Purpose

This protocol defines structural constraints required for DKP to remain operational under adversarial conditions, including social, institutional, and systemic pressure.

Resilience is defined as:

continuity of function under pressure without dependency on protected actors

\---

2\. System Position

PTL → Measurement → Enforcement → Integration → Resilience → Scaling

\---

3\. Core Principle

DKP must remain operational without dependency on:

any individual actor

any centralized authority

any permission layer

\---

4\. Threat Model (Non-exhaustive)

4.1 L6 Social Distortion

narrative substitution

semantic degradation

reputational targeting

4.2 L7 Institutional Pressure

access restriction

regulatory blocking

infrastructure denial

4.3 L7 Structural Absorption

co-option into existing systems

conversion into advisory layer

loss of enforcement binding

4.4 Undefined (Flagged)

physical suppression scenarios  
(handled via structural invariants only)

\---

5\. Invariants

5.1 No Single Point of Failure

No function of DKP may depend on a unique actor, node, or interface

Constraint extension:

System must remain valid only if N\_eff ≥ N\_eff\_min (DKP-0-ORACLE-001)

If violated → system enters invalid state (no enforcement)

\---

5.2 Non-personalization

DKP must not be representable as an individual or leadership structure

\---

5.3 Measurement Supremacy Preservation

All enforcement must remain bound to measurable physical states (PTL)

Forbidden:

narrative override

expert override

institutional override

Interop constraint:

If external systems require human validation,  
DKP outputs may be mirrored but not altered (DKP-8-INTEROP-001)

\---

5.4 Non-confrontational Integration (Revised)

DKP must not require explicit displacement of existing systems to operate

Clarification:

DKP operates as a constraint layer,  
not as a governance replacement mechanism

\---

5.5 Functional Irreplaceability (Revised)

DKP components must produce measurable dependency through constraint enforcement

Replaces previous ambiguous formulation.

Clarification:

Irreplaceability is emergent, not imposed

Constraint:

If DKP removal causes no measurable change in system constraints,  
DKP is not yet integrated (not a resilience condition)

Resolution of paradox:

5.4 prohibits forced displacement

5.5 defines emergent dependency via constraints

No contradiction remains.

\---

5.6 Scope Isolation

Resilience mechanisms must not alter core axioms or enforcement logic

Reference: DKP-7-SCOPE-001

\---

5.7 Interface Integrity (NEW — fixes Bundle Distortion)

All Entry Points must preserve minimum PTL metadata completeness

Requirement:

no partial state exposure

no semantic filtering

no aggregation that hides variance

Reference: DKP-PTL-REG-DATA-001

Violation leads to:

local invalidation of entry point

\---

5.8 Anti-Sybil Consistency (NEW)

Node concentration must not exceed limits defined in DKP-0-ORACLE-001

Implication:

distributed nodes must remain statistically independent

artificial scaling does not increase influence

\---

6\. Allowed Structural Patterns

6.1 Distributed Entry Points

multiple independent implementations

no canonical interface required

MUST comply with 5.7 (metadata completeness)

\---

6.2 Local-first Deployment

system functional at micro-level before scaling

\---

6.3 Passive Adoption Model

adoption via utility, not mandate

\---

6.4 Constraint-driven Interaction

behavior influenced only via measurable limits

\---

7\. Forbidden Structural Patterns

7.1 Central Authority Node

7.2 Identity-bound Trust

7.3 Narrative Dependence

7.4 Enforcement via Interpretation

(unchanged, consistent)

\---

8\. Failure Modes

8.1 Personalization Collapse

8.2 Soft Capture

8.3 Metric Corruption

(unchanged)

\---

8.4 Statistical Collapse (NEW)

N\_eff \< N\_eff\_min  
→ oracle inconsistency  
→ enforcement invalid  
→ system enters null-output state

Reference: DKP-0-ORACLE-001

\---

8.5 Interface Degradation (NEW)

Entry Points provide incomplete PTL state  
→ local distortion  
→ cascade to soft capture

\---

9\. Resilience Mechanism

DKP resists suppression through:

absence of target

absence of override layer

PTL binding

distributed enforcement

statistical validity constraints

\---

10\. Boundary Conditions

10.1 Crisis Conditions

Resilience does not override:

DKP-4-CRISIS-001

DKP-7-SCOPE-001

Crisis actions:

no precedent

no centralization

\---

10.2 Undefined Zone

Physical threat to actors not handled directly  
→ mitigated via 5.1 (non-dependence)

\---

11\. Validation Criteria

System is resilient if:

removal of any actor has zero functional impact

N\_eff remains above threshold

no entry point distorts PTL state

enforcement remains automatic and measurable

system continues under access restriction

\---

12\. Key Constraint

Resilience must emerge from structure, not protection

\---

13\. Final Statement

DKP does not defend itself

It remains:  
non-targetable  
non-overridable  
non-distortable

\---
