DKP-2-ASSETS-001
Property & Assets Protocol
Version
0.1.1
Status
Final Review Candidate

1. Purpose
The Property & Assets Protocol defines how assets, resources, and property rights
 are established, maintained, constrained, revoked, and reallocated within the
 Dikenocracy system.
Property is not treated as an absolute or intrinsic right.
 It is defined as a conditional, revocable allocation of control, justified
 exclusively by measurable contribution and bounded by justice and physical reality.
This protocol ensures that:
ownership reflects net justice contribution,
accumulation cannot externalize harm,
assets cannot be used to bypass axiomatic limits,
property remains subordinate to impact, causality, and truth.

2. System Position
This protocol operates:
strictly downstream of DKP-0-ORACLE-001 (Physical Truth Layer),
above all L1 protocols (AXIOMS, IMPACT, IDENTITY, JUSTICE),
alongside DKP-2-FINANCE-001,
below social, labor, security, crisis, and infrastructure protocols (L3–L5).

All asset-related decisions are invalid in the presence of a
 Physical Truth Layer systemic halt or unresolved divergence.

3. Core Definitions

3.1 Asset
An Asset is any physical, informational, or infrastructural entity that:
can be controlled, excluded, or transferred,
produces measurable impact across one or more impact channels,
enables production, accumulation, or systemic influence.

Assets include, but are not limited to:
land and natural resources,
infrastructure and machinery,
informational and intellectual systems,
productive capital and financial instruments,
algorithmic, digital, or networked systems.

3.2 Property Right
A Property Right is a system-granted, conditional permission to control,
 use, or derive benefit from an Asset.
Property Rights are:
non-absolute,
non-permanent,
continuously impact-contingent,
subordinate to justice outcomes and axiomatic constraints.

4. Ownership Granting Conditions
A Property Right MAY be granted only if all of the following hold:
a) the Subject demonstrates non-negative net justice contribution,
 b) projected asset use remains within impact bounds,
 c) axiomatic priorities are not violated,
 d) the Subject retains capacity for harm mitigation and restitution.
Ownership SHALL NOT be granted solely on the basis of:
prior possession,
inheritance without obligation transfer,
contractual abstraction detached from measurable impact.

5. Conditionality and Persistence
Property Rights persist only while:
justice contribution remains non-negative,
asset use complies with impact constraints,
restitution obligations are satisfied.

Failure of any condition SHALL trigger automatic degradation,
 restriction, or suspension of the Property Right.
No Property Right is permanent.

6. Asset Use Constraints
Assets MUST NOT be used to:
amplify irreversible harm,
externalize damage beyond system boundaries,
bypass justice or identity attribution,
violate axiomatic priorities.

Asset use that increases systemic risk or irreversible damage
 constitutes grounds for restriction or revocation.

7. Accumulation and Concentration Limits
Asset accumulation is subject to impact-based concentration constraints.
Where accumulation:
increases systemic fragility,
enables coercive dominance,
amplifies irreversible or cascading harm,
the protocol SHALL trigger:
graduated restrictions,
enforced divestment,
partial or full reallocation.

Concentration thresholds are derived from impact metrics,
 not nominal valuation or market price.

8. Revocation and Reallocation
8.1 Revocation Triggers
Property Rights SHALL be revoked when:
justice outcomes mandate Restriction, Isolation, or Exclusion,
asset use causes irreversible or systemic harm,
restitution obligations cannot be fulfilled.

Revocation is a functional correction, not punishment.

8.2 Reallocation Mechanisms
Revoked assets MAY be:
placed under public stewardship,
reassigned to alternative Subjects,
transferred to reserve or mitigation pools.

Reallocation SHALL prioritize:
harm mitigation,
continuity of essential services,
protection of axiomatic priorities.

Reallocation Transparency Constraint
All asset reallocation processes SHALL be:
publicly observable,
fully auditable,
traceable to justice outcomes and impact constraints,
executed via deterministic, rule-based procedures.

No discretionary authority, closed committee, or opaque administrative body
 MAY control or override asset reallocation.
Public stewardship denotes algorithmic custodianship under open rules,
 not bureaucratic management.

9. Natural and Critical Assets
Certain assets are designated as Non-Privatizable or
 Conditionally Privatizable, including:
biosphere-critical systems,
water, air, and ecological infrastructure,
essential cognitive and informational commons.
Such assets MAY only be held under strict stewardship conditions
 and SHALL always remain revocable.

10. Transfer and Inheritance
Any transfer of property rights, including inheritance, requires:
explicit transfer of justice obligations,
acceptance of ongoing responsibility,
compliance with current impact constraints.
Inheritance SHALL NOT erase historical attribution
 or exempt the recipient from justice outcomes.

11. Justice-Driven Asset Access Constraint
If a Subject is placed under Restriction, Isolation, or Exclusion
 per DKP-1-JUSTICE-001:
control over non-essential assets SHALL be restricted or suspended,
asset-derived benefits MAY be limited,
access necessary for preservation of life SHALL be maintained
 in accordance with Axiom A1.

This protocol SHALL NOT override justice outcomes.

12. Transparency and Identity Binding
All asset ownership and control structures MUST be:
registered,
publicly auditable,
directly and unambiguously bindable to Subjects
 as defined in DKP-1-IDENTITY-001.

Hidden ownership, shell abstractions, offshore structures,
 or any form of control that prevents causal attribution
 of impact or responsibility are forbidden.
Identity Binding Requirement
Any ownership abstraction that obstructs causal attribution
 SHALL be treated as invalid within the system.
This requirement is a necessary condition for the operation
 of DKP-1-IDENTITY-001 and cannot be waived.

13. Cross-Layer Isolation
This protocol SHALL NOT:
redefine justice logic,
alter impact measurements,
introduce policy discretion,
create exemptions from axiomatic constraints.
Violation constitutes a critical architectural breach.

14. Protocol Finality
Once finalized, this protocol is immutable.
Any modification requires:
a new protocol identifier,
explicit declaration of incompatibility,
full-system simulation under DKP-8-SIMULATION.
