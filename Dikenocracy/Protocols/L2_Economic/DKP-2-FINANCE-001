DKP-2-FINANCE-001
Financial System Protocol
Version
0.1.1
Status
Final Review Candidate

1. Purpose
The Financial System Protocol defines how financial activity — including savings, lending, credit issuance, investment, capital allocation, and pricing of capital — operates within the Dikenocracy system.
The protocol embeds δίκη (justice as a function) directly into financial mechanics, ensuring that:
cost of capital reflects measured impact and responsibility,
externalities are internalized deterministically,
financial incentives align with long-term physical and social stability.

This protocol governs economic mechanics, not policy discretion.
It does not:
create or manage fiat monetary regimes,
override justice outcomes,
perform subjective valuation or preference aggregation,
substitute for governance or social support layers.

2. System Position
This protocol operates:
above all L1 protocols
 (DKP-1-AXIOMS-001, DKP-1-IMPACT-001, DKP-1-IDENTITY-001, DKP-1-JUSTICE-001),
below social, infrastructural, and intersystem protocols (L5–L6),
alongside security and fail-safe mechanisms (L3–L4).

All financial computations MUST be traceable to:
measured impact outputs (DKP-1-IMPACT-001),
responsibility bindings (DKP-1-IDENTITY-001),
justice outcomes (DKP-1-JUSTICE-001),
axiomatic constraints (DKP-1-AXIOMS-001).

3. Core Economic Units
3.1 Capital Units (CU)
Capital Units (CU) are unitless, fungible representations of deployable economic capacity within the system.
CU represent productive capability net of justice-weighted externalities, not nominal wealth.
All CU flows are recorded on a deterministic, auditable ledger.

3.2 Justice-Weighted Cost of Capital (JWCoC)
The cost of capital is determined as a deterministic function of:
historical justice outcomes associated with a Subject,
projected impact risks across relevant channels,
axiomatic reference bounds and safety margins.

Positive justice contribution reduces cost of capital.
 Negative or risky impact exposure increases cost of capital.
There is no discretionary pricing of risk.

4. Time, Risk, and Capital Pricing

4.1 Justice-Anchored Interest
Interest rates are computed as a function of:
justice burden carried by the borrower,
impact volatility and externality exposure,
reversibility and mitigation capacity.

Interest is not compensation for impatience,
 but a pricing of measured risk and justice imbalance.

4.2 Time Value of Capital (Strict Constraint)
The system explicitly rejects subjective time preference.
Explicit Time Preference Prohibition
Subjective time preference, impatience discounting, or utility-based
 devaluation of future outcomes SHALL NOT be used in any financial computation
 within this protocol.
Temporal discounting is permitted exclusively as a consequence of
 measurable changes in projected impact channels over time,
 as defined by DKP-1-IMPACT-001.
This constraint is mandatory and reflects Axiom A2
 (Intergenerational Responsibility) as defined in DKP-1-AXIOMS-001.

5. Credit and Lending
5.1 Credit Issuance
Credit MAY be issued only if:
a) projected justice-weighted productive output is sufficient for repayment,
 b) expected impact does not violate axiomatic bounds,
 c) aggregate exposure remains within systemic safety margins.
Credit is a temporary imbalance, not a right.

5.2 Credit Limits
Credit limits are dynamically computed based on:
justice history of the Subject,
projected impact correlation,
systemic stress indicators.

No Subject may increase leverage if doing so raises the probability
 of axiom-bound violation.

6. Savings and Reserves
6.1 Savings
Savings are CU held in reserve and may generate returns derived from:
duration of deployment,
justice-weighted performance of deployed capital,
measured systemic risk.

Savings returns are deterministic and fully auditable.

6.2 Systemic Reserve Pools (SRP)
Systemic Reserve Pools exist to:
absorb defaults,
fund restitution obligations,
prevent cascading systemic failure.
Reserve sizing is impact-based, not percentage-based.

7. Investment and Capital Allocation
Capital allocation decisions SHALL be driven by:
expected net justice output,
impact risk envelopes,
alignment with axiomatic priorities.

Speculative or purely price-driven allocation is forbidden.

8. Default and Financial Restitution
8.1 Default Conditions
A default occurs when:
repayment cannot be achieved within a justice-defined horizon, and
continued exposure threatens axiomatic bounds.

Defaults trigger justice-defined outcomes, not punishment.

8.2 Restitution Handling
Restitution MAY include:
reserve deployment,
obligation restructuring,
proportional loss allocation.

Restitution is bounded by measurable damage and justice outcomes.

9. Leverage and Systemic Risk
Leverage SHALL be constrained such that:
amplification of negative impact remains below safety thresholds,
correlated failures cannot cascade beyond reserve capacity.

Leverage limits are impact-based, not volatility-based.

10. Interoperability with External Financial Systems
When interfacing with external systems:
all values MUST be translated into justice-weighted internal equivalents,
external risk MUST be fully internalized before deployment.

No external financial structure may bypass justice constraints.

11. Justice-Driven Financial Access Constraint
11.1 Automatic Suspension under Exclusion
If a Subject is assigned to the Exclusion Domain
 under DKP-1-JUSTICE-001, all financial access governed by this protocol
 SHALL be automatically suspended.
This suspension is causal, not discretionary,
 and requires no independent financial evaluation.
The Financial System Protocol SHALL NOT:
override exclusion outcomes,
re-enable access under alternative criteria,
provide compensatory financial pathways.

Financial access MAY be restored only upon formal exit from
 the Exclusion Domain as determined by DKP-1-JUSTICE-001.

12. Transparency and Auditability
All financial mechanisms MUST be:
deterministic,
reproducible,
fully auditable,
traceable to L1 protocol outputs.

Opaque, discretionary, or proprietary financial logic is forbidden.

13. Cross-Layer Isolation
This protocol SHALL NOT:
reinterpret impact measurements,
override identity attribution,
override justice outcomes,
inject policy, ideology, or moral judgment.
Violation constitutes a critical architectural breach.

14. Protocol Finality
Once finalized, this protocol is immutable.
Any modification requires:
a new protocol identifier,
explicit declaration of incompatibility,
full-system simulation under DKP-8-SIMULATION.
