DKP-2-LABOR-001
Labor & Participation Protocol
Version
0.1.1
Status
Final Review Candidate

1. Purpose
The Labor & Participation Protocol defines how participation in productive,
 restorative, and socially stabilizing activity is organized within the
 Dikenocracy system.
Labor is not treated as coercion, obligation, or moral duty.
 It is defined as a measurable mechanism for restoring and maintaining
 justice balance, enabling Subjects to:
contribute to system stability,
access non-essential resources,
recover from negative justice states,
participate without ideological, political, or cultural conformity.

This protocol ensures that no Subject is forced into labor to preserve life,
 while preserving accountability for measurable impact.

2. System Position
This protocol operates:
strictly downstream of DKP-0-ORACLE-001 (Physical Truth Layer),
above all L1 protocols (AXIOMS, IMPACT, IDENTITY, JUSTICE),
alongside DKP-2-FINANCE-001 and DKP-2-ASSETS-001,
below crisis, security, social, and education protocols (L3–L5).

All participation rules are invalid during a PTL systemic halt
 or unresolved divergence.

3. Core Definitions

3.1 Labor
Labor is any voluntary, sustained activity that:
produces measurable impact under DKP-1-IMPACT-001,
contributes to restoration, maintenance, or protection of
 physical, social, or informational stability,
can be causally attributed to a Subject.

Labor includes, but is not limited to:
physical and infrastructural work,
cognitive and creative activity,
caregiving and social support,
maintenance of critical knowledge and skills,
restorative or preventive actions.

3.2 Participation
Participation is the voluntary engagement of a Subject
 in recognized labor or restorative activity.
Participation is evaluated exclusively through measured impact.
 Intent, belief, ideology, or declared motivation are irrelevant.

3.3 Contribution Record
A Contribution Record is an immutable, time-indexed entry linking:
a Subject,
a participation activity,
measured impact outputs,
resulting justice adjustment.

4. Baseline Access Guarantee
4.1 Non-Conditional Survival Access
Every Subject SHALL retain access to minimum life-preserving resources,
 independent of labor participation, in accordance with
 Axiom A1 (Preservation of Life).
No Subject may be deprived of:
basic nutrition,
shelter from lethal exposure,
emergency medical assistance.

Baseline survival access SHALL NOT be contingent on labor,
 obedience, loyalty, or economic productivity.

4.2 Baseline Does Not Neutralize Responsibility
Baseline access preserves life only.
 It does NOT neutralize negative justice balance
 or eliminate responsibility for harm.
Restoration of full participation and access requires
 measurable contribution or restitution.

5. Participation and Justice Recovery

5.1 Voluntary Restoration Pathways
Subjects in a negative justice state SHALL be offered
 voluntary participation pathways enabling recovery
 through contribution.
These pathways MUST be:
transparent,
non-punitive,
non-humiliating,
scaled to Subject capacity and context.

Participation opportunities SHALL be plural and diverse,
 preventing exploitation, monoculture, or forced specialization.

5.2 Justice Recovery Through Labor
Justice recovery is computed as a deterministic function of:
measured impact of participation,
relevance to harmed impact channels,
time horizon of contribution.

Symbolic, performative, or purely declarative activity
 SHALL NOT be recognized as labor.

6. Prohibited Labor Conditions
Labor participation SHALL NOT:
be compulsory for survival,
be used as punishment,
involve debt bondage or open-ended obligation,
require ideological, cultural, or political alignment,
be assigned based on status, origin, or identity.

Forced labor constitutes a critical violation
 of axiomatic constraints.

7. Allocation of Participation Opportunities
Participation opportunities SHALL be allocated based on:
system needs derived from impact deficits,
Subject capacity and explicit consent,
avoidance of concentration, exploitation, or dependency.

No centralized authority MAY monopolize assignment.
All allocation procedures MUST be transparent,
 auditable, and rule-based.

8. Compensation and Recognition
8.1 Justice-Linked Compensation
Compensation for participation MAY include:
Capital Units (CU),
access to assets or services,
relaxation of justice-derived restrictions,
partial or full restoration of participation rights.

Compensation is proportional to measured impact,
 not hours worked, status, or bargaining power.

8.2 Non-Market and Socially Stabilizing Contributions
Non-market contributions SHALL be recognized as valid labor
 when they produce measurable stabilizing impact, including:
caregiving for dependents or vulnerable persons,
maintenance of social cohesion and continuity,
preservation, transmission, and safeguarding of knowledge,
prevention of systemic degradation not captured by markets.

Such contributions address otherwise invisible externalities
 and are evaluated using appropriate physical or informational proxies
 under DKP-1-IMPACT-001.

9. Refusal, Exit, and Crisis Modulation

9.1 Right to Refuse Participation
Outside formally declared crisis conditions,
 no Subject SHALL be compelled to participate in labor.
Refusal of participation:
does not constitute a violation,
does not trigger punishment,
does not affect baseline survival access.

9.2 Crisis Modulation of Participation
During a formally declared crisis under DKP-4-CRISIS-001,
 where failure of participation would threaten
 systemic survival or collapse, the right to refuse
 participation MAY be temporarily constrained.

Such constraints MUST:
be strictly time-limited,
be proportionate to the declared threat,
preserve Axiom A1 (Preservation of Life),
prioritize Axiom A2 (Systemic Sustainability).

Crisis modulation SHALL NOT create permanent obligations
 or post-crisis penalties.

10. Participation Under Restriction or Isolation
Subjects under Restriction or Isolation
 per DKP-1-JUSTICE-001:
MAY participate in limited or supervised activities,
MUST retain pathways for justice recovery,
SHALL NOT be exploited or coerced.

Participation remains voluntary outside crisis conditions.

11. Transparency and Identity Binding

All participation and contribution records MUST be:
directly bindable to identifiable Subjects
(DKP-1-IDENTITY-001),
publicly auditable,
traceable to measured impact outputs.

Proxy, fictitious, or obscured participation is forbidden.

12. Cross-Layer Isolation
This protocol SHALL NOT:
redefine justice logic,
override impact measurements,
function as punishment or discipline,
introduce ideological criteria.

Violation constitutes a critical architectural breach.

13. Protocol Finality
Once finalized, this protocol is immutable.
Any modification requires:
a new protocol identifier,
explicit incompatibility declaration,
full-system simulation under DKP-8-SIMULATION.
