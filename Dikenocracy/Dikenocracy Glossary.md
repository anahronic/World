# Dikenocracy Glossary Core Concepts

##  Here is the complete glossary of terms, compiled from the document "Dikenocracy SYNERGY and 30 PROTOCOLS" and its appendices.

| Term | Definition |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Dikenocracy** | A form of algorithmic state governance based on the principle of *δίκη* (Dike): justice as an objective and measurable balance between a subject's actions and the system's stability. Power is held by the function of justice itself, formalized in open algorithms, public metrics, and automated procedures. |
| **δίκη (Dike)** | The principle underlying Dikenocracy. Defined as an objective and measurable balance between a subject's actions and the system's stability, designed to avoid subjective decisions. |
| **Algorithmic Authority** | Normative, not agentive, authority. Algorithms define binding decision rules and execution constraints but do not bear causal or legal responsibility. All responsibility remains fully attributable to the originating Subjects. |
| **Axioms** | Non-negotiable, invariant constraints that define the boundary conditions of the system. They are not moral statements or policy goals but constrain how data-derived metrics may be interpreted and acted upon. **Example:** Axiom A1 — Preservation of Life, which has absolute priority. |
| **Main Equation of Civilization Motion** | The fundamental mathematical model (based on TIU) describing the balance between Global Welfare ($W(t)$), the total egoistic activity of all agents ($E(t)$), the rate of technological expansion ($T(t)$), and the Biosphere Health Index ($B(t)$). The network must maintain $\\frac{dW}{dt} \\ge k \\cdot E(t) \\cdot T(t) \\cdot B(t)^{2.83}$. |
| **TIU (Theory of the Informational Universe)** | The fundamental physical model upon which Dikenocracy is based. It addresses the question of "how reality works." |
| **Genesis Block** | The primary data block in the chain (Block Height 0\) that has no predecessor. It rigidly fixes the system's initial parameters, physical constants, and the planet's state at the moment of launch (December 10, 2025). It serves as an immutable reference point. |
| **Immutable Message** | A text manifesto cryptographically embedded in the Genesis Block code, declaring the refusal to attempt to "fix" the old system in favor of building a new parallel reality. |
| **Proof-of-Synergy (PoS)** | A consensus protocol replacing traditional Proof-of-Work/Stake. Block validation is based on a proven contribution to reducing system entropy (biosphere restoration, social stability, technological efficiency). |

Protocols and Technical Components

| Term | Definition |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Physical Truth Layer (PTL)** | The layer of objective truth. A network of verified hardware oracles (satellites, sensors, IoT) that transmit data about the physical world's state directly to the blockchain. It is the sole admissible interface between physical reality and the Dikenocracy governance system. |
| **B (Biosphere Integrity Index)** | A dynamic calculated index (from 0 to 1\) reflecting the planetary system's ability to support life. $B\_{min} \= 0.68$ is the critical threshold (point of no return). |
| **Oracle Source** | A hardware-bound system producing cryptographically signed physical measurements, traceable to a registered oracle identity. |
| **Independent Oracle Classes** | Distinct measurement modalities defined by the physical separation of sensing mechanisms: **Orbital**, **Ground**, and **Autonomous**. Used to detect divergence. |
| **Divergence Event** | A statistically significant disagreement between posterior distributions produced by **independent oracle classes** that differs by more than **7%**. Triggers the freezing of all dependent state-based transactions. |
| **DKP-0-TIME-001 (DTI)** | Dikenocratic Time & Date Index Protocol. Defines a non-religious, event-neutral, deterministic system for counting days and years within the Dikenocracy framework. |
| **DTI-Day** | The canonical absolute civil day index, which is equivalent to the **JDN (Julian Day Number)**. |
| **DTI-Year (DY)** | A governance year consisting of exactly **360 consecutive DTI-Days**. It has no leap days or variable rules. |
| **Subject** | Any entity (individual human, legal entity, AI, algorithmic system) capable of initiating, amplifying, sustaining, or failing to prevent a state transition that is measurable under the Impact Measurement Protocol (DKP-1-IMPACT-001). The status is functional, not moral or legal. |
| **Responsibility** | The persistence of causal linkage between a Subject and measurable impacts arising from its actions or omissions, independent of intent, awareness, foresight, or justification. |

Economy and Governance (Code of Planetary Synergy)

| Term | Definition |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Dual-Circuit Economy** | The global economy is divided into two independent circuits: **Basic** (consumption, resources, land) and **Venture** (space, fundamental science, AI). |
| **Law of Dynamic Standard (Mirror Peg)** | The value of currencies and assets in the Basic circuit of developed nations is rigidly pegged to the 5-year moving average of economic growth in the bottom 20% of countries (Development Quintile). |
| **Venture Gateway** | Capital in the Venture circuit is exempt from the Mirror Peg and taxes, provided the **Open Tech Pledge** is signed, which requires the release of developments to the public domain after 5 years. |
| **Snap Protocol (Emergency Transparency)** | In the event of a sharp drop (more than 10% per month) in indicators in any region (war, repression), smoothing is disabled, and the aggressor's quotes in the Basic circuit crash instantly. |
| **Law of Conditioned Emission** | Financing from global funds is carried out exclusively through targeted smart contracts and is unlocked algorithmically only upon the completion of physically verifiable KPIs (built, cured, educated). |
| **Virtual Factory Principle (Tokenized Value Chain)** | The resource-exporting country automatically receives equity tokens (shares) in the processing enterprises using this resource, regardless of their geography, guaranteeing profits from the final high-tech product. |
| **Peace Staking** | An economic collateral mechanism where a state deposits a pledge (Stake) into an Escrow smart contract to access the Global Trade Network. In the event of aggression, the stake is automatically burned (**Slashing**). |
| **Kill Switch Law** | In the event of military aggression or exhaustion of the Peace Stake, the violating region is automatically disconnected from the global financial, energy, and logistical infrastructure. |
| **Managerial Governance** | The institution of irremovable power is abolished. Territories are managed by Regional Operators, hired for the duration of a specific KPI. |
| **Glass Pocket Law** | All state/regional budget transactions are displayed on a public blockchain in real-time. Secret expenditure items are prohibited. |
| **Full Product Cost** | The cost of full disposal and environmental damage restoration is algorithmically included in the price of any good. |
| **Guardian Status** | Residents of Biosphere Reserves, who receive the status of **Biosphere Operators**. Their income is generated by a smart contract based on sensor data (biomass index, CO2 levels, biodiversity). |
| **Unconditional Basic Resource (UBR)** | A minimum set of resources for survival (food, shelter, connectivity) guaranteed to every human by right of birth. |
| **Wild Node** | A network node launched by an independent party (city, corporation, or community) without prior coordination with the founders, but in full compliance with the protocol, confirming the system's decentralization. |
| **Dead Man Switch** | A security mechanism: upon physical seizure or destruction of any critical node, $\\ge 50%$ of all global Peace Stakes are automatically burned and distributed to the remaining nodes, making an attack economic suicide. |
| **Crisis Mercy Exception (Compassion Clause)** | A temporary (180-day) suspension of the Snap Protocol and all Kill Switches in the event of confirmed non-anthropogenic global physical events (e.g., Eruption $\>$ VEI-6, Asteroid $\>$ 200m, Pandemic with lethality $\>$ 15%). |
